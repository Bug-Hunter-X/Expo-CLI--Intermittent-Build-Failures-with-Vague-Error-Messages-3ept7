# Expo CLI: Intermittent Build Failures

This repository demonstrates a problem with Expo CLI where builds fail intermittently without providing clear error messages. The build process starts but then stops abruptly, making debugging difficult.

## Bug Description

The issue manifests as inconsistent build failures. Sometimes the build process completes successfully, while other times it stops unexpectedly without any detailed error messages, stack traces, or clues about the cause. This occurs without any apparent changes to the code or environment.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo start`.
3. Attempt to build the project using `expo build:ios` or `expo build:android`.  Observe that the build may succeed or fail randomly.

## Potential Causes (Speculation)

* **Network issues:** Intermittent network connectivity could lead to build failures, though this does not explain the lack of specific error details.
* **Expo CLI bug:** A potential bug in the Expo CLI itself could cause unexpected build terminations.
* **Resource exhaustion:** It's possible that the build process is occasionally encountering resource limitations (CPU or memory) leading to its termination.

## Workaround (Not a solution)

Trying the build process multiple times might eventually succeed.  This is not a reliable solution, however.
