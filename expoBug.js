While using Expo CLI, I encountered an unusual error during the build process.  The error message was vague and didn't pinpoint the exact cause. The build process would start, but then suddenly stop without providing a stack trace or detailed explanation. This happened inconsistently, sometimes succeeding and other times failing without any apparent changes to the codebase or environment.
